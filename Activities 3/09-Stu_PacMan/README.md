# Pac Man

In this activity you will be creating a CSS animation to help Pac-Man navigate through a maze.

## Instructions

- Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your web browser and take a moment to study the rendered HTML page.

- Add code here to animate the `#pac-man` element to the other side of the maze without bumping into any walls.

- **This is the only code you need to modify**

### Hints

- You can move Pac Man by modifying either his margin, his left, right, bottom, top, properties, or by using the CSS `transform: translate` rule like some of the previous examples demonstrated.

- Don't worry about responsiveness here, just get Pac-Man through the maze without hitting any walls on *your* computer screen.

- This will take some trial and error to get right.
