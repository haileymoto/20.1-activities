# Transitions

- In this activity you will define pseudo-classes for pre-built HTML elements and use the CSS transition property to animate how each element changes.

## Instructions

- Open [solved.html](Solved/solved.html) in your web browser and take a moment to study the rendered page.

  - You should see a Bootstrap button, input, and progress bar.

- Using the `:active` pseudo selector, add code so that when the button is clicked, at least 3 CSS rules are updated. Be sure to add a `transition` rule so that the changes happen over the course of a few seconds.

- Using the `:focus` pseudo selector, add code so that when the input element is focused on (the cursor is inside of the input), it should shrink in width over the course of a few seconds.

- Using the `:hover` pseudo selector, add code so that the `.progess-bar` element's width goes to 100% over the course of a few seconds.

### Hints

- Don't modify any of the provided CSS. It's required for everything to work properly.

- Refer back to the previous example if needed!
