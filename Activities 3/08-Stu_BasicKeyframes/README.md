# Basic Transformations: Pulse

In this activity, you will use keyframes to create the effect of a pulsing box.

## Instructions

- Take a minute to look over the code given to you in the starter files.

- Add code to the `@keyframes` rule of the `pulse.css` file in order to have the box shrink and expand.

- Alter the `animation` property so that the animation occurs ten times.
